**dbt · DuckDB · Airflow · Product Analytics · SQL**

Production-grade **customer lifecycle analytics** for a FinTech SuperApp integrating **BNPL, engagement, and loyalty**. Built to mirror **Tabby-scale product analytics** with enterprise-grade data quality and testing.

**Scale & Impact:**
- **$68.2M total GMV** processed across **224K+ transactions**
- **50K+ customers** tracked through activation → retention → reactivation
- **141K+ installments** analyzed for payment behavior patterns
- **4,200+ loyalty events** tied to repeat purchase analysis

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Layered dbt project:** staging (7 models) → intermediate (4 models) → marts (6 models)
- **68 automated data quality tests** with 100% pass rate
- **Incremental materialization** with date partitioning and customer/merchant clustering
- **Full data lineage** with interactive DAG visualization
- **Airflow orchestration** for daily pipeline execution (2 AM UTC)
- **CI/CD integration** with automated testing on pull requests

**Product Analytics Coverage:**
- **Activation Analysis:** Signup → first BNPL → repeat usage funnel
- **Retention Tracking:** D7/D30 cohort behavior and churn patterns
- **Reactivation Intelligence:** Win-back opportunity identification after inactivity
- **Loyalty Engineering:** Engagement scoring tied to repeat GMV performance
- **Cross-Product Analytics:** Multi-service usage patterns within SuperApp ecosystem

**Business Metrics Delivered:**
- BNPL adoption rate: **77.3%**
