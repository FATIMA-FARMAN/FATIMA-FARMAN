TL;DR — What I Do

I build end-to-end People Analytics pipelines that turn HRIS + ATS data into actionable dashboards for hiring leaders and executives.

✅ Focus Areas:
 
“Focused on analytics engineering, dbt modeling, and executive-ready people metrics for high-growth fintechs.”

Attrition modeling & risk prediction

Hiring funnel diagnostics (conversion, bottlenecks, time-in-stage)

Executive dashboards with filters & prioritization

🔧 Tools:

SQL (BigQuery) • Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Power BI • Tableau • Looker Studio

🧠 Strength:
From raw HR/ATS data → warehouse-style marts → leadership-ready insights
Designed for decision-making, not just reporting.

Projects simulate real-world fintech HR environments using mock HRIS/ATS datasets.
